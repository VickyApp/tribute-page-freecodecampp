                <h2>Introduce</h2>
                <p>Sukarno (June 6, 1901â€“June 21, 1970) was the first leader of independent Indonesia. Born in Java when the island was part of the Dutch East Indies, Sukarno rose to power in 1949. Rather than supporting Indonesia's original parliamentary system, he created a "guided democracy" over which he held control. Sukarno was deposed by a military coup in 1965 and died under house arrest in 1970.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Sukarno was born on June 6, 1901, in Surabaya, and was given the name Kusno Sosrodihardjo. His parents later renamed him Sukarno after he survived a serious illness. Sukarno's father was Raden Soekemi Sosrodihardjo, a Muslim aristocrat and school teacher from Java. His mother Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai was a Hindu of the Brahmin caste from Bali.</p>
                <p>Young Sukarno went to a local elementary school until 1912. He then attended a Dutch middle school in Mojokerto, followed in 1916 by a Dutch high school in Surabaya. The young man was gifted with a photographic memory and a talent for languages, including Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, Dutch, English, French, Arabic, Bahasa Indonesia, German, and Japanese.</p>

                <h2>Indonesian Independence Movement</h2>
                <p>Sukarno began to think about independence for the Dutch East Indies while he was in high school. During college, he read deeply on different political philosophies, including communism, capitalist democracy, and Islamism, developing his own syncretic ideology of Indonesian socialist self-sufficiency. He also established the Algameene Studieclub for like-minded Indonesian students.</p>
                <p>In 1927, Sukarno and the other members of the Algameene Studieclub reorganized themselves as the</p>
                <p>The Dutch colonial secret police soon learned of the PNI, and in late December 1929, Sukarno and the other members were arrested. At his trial, which lasted for the last five months of 1930, Sukarno made a series of impassioned political speeches against imperialism that attracted widespread attention.</p>
                <p>Sukarno was sentenced to four years in prison and went to the Sukamiskin Prison in Bandung to begin serving his time. However, press coverage of his speeches so impressed liberal factions in the Netherlands and in the Dutch East Indies that Sukarno was released after just one year. He had also become very popular with the Indonesian people.</p>
                <p>While Sukarno was in prison, the PNI split into two opposing factions. One party, the Partai Indonesia, favored a militant approach to revolution, while the Pendidikan Nasional Indonesia (PNI Baroe) advocated slow revolution through education and peaceful resistance. Sukarno agreed with the Partai Indonesia approach more than the PNI's, so he became the head of that party in 1932 after his release from prison. On August 1, 1933, the Dutch police arrested Sukarno once again while he was visiting Jakarta.</p>

                <h2>Declaration of Independence for Indonesia</h2>
                <p>In June 1945, Sukarno introduced his five-point Pancasila, or principles of an independent Indonesia. They included a belief in God but tolerance of all religions, internationalism and just humanity, the unity of all Indonesia, democracy through consensus, and social justice for all.</p>
                <p>On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers.</p>
                <p>On August 18 at 10 a.m., Sukarno spoke to a crowd of 500 in front of his home and declared the Republic of Indonesia independent, with himself serving as president and his friend Mohammad Hatta as vice president. He also promulgated the 1945 Indonesian Constitution, which included the Pancasila.</p>
                <p>Although the Japanese troops still in the country tried to suppress news of the declaration, word spread quickly through the grapevine. One month later, on September 19, 1945, Sukarno spoke to a crowd of more than one million at Merdeka Square in Jakarta. The new independence government controlled Java and Sumatra, while the Japanese maintained their hold on the other islands; the Dutch and other Allied Powers had yet to show up.</p>
